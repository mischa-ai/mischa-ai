### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mischa and my vision is to create spaces, both physical and digital in which humans can experience and learn about the possibilities that robots and AI brings us.

I do so by creating interactive, collaborative artworks that involve both human and AI elements, using robots that can draw on a canvas while moving around. The outcome of this interaction is the final drawing or artwork that is created.

## Stages

### Stage 0

- [x] Build simple robot prototypes to prove the idea of drawing robots (no real AI) , show at some events (done around 2015).

### Stage 1 (current WIP)

Controll only at live events

- [x] Build robots that are actually controlled by AI
- [ ] Add function that humans can request controll via mobile phone or game controller
- [ ] Present at some events to create interactive art and get feedback
- [ ] Live Streaming of complete canvas area
- [ ] Live streaming of robot PoV

### Stage 2

Controll over the internet

- [ ] public website to see if live event is ongoing
- [ ] Web App to request controll over internet

### Stage 3

Blockchain FTW

- [ ] add blockchain to robots operating system
- [ ] create NFTs from resulting artpiece and give to participants for free as prove of participation :)
